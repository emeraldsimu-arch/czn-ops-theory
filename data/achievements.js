// NEXUS v5.15 — ACHIEVEMENTS
// SIGNAL → OPERATIVE → VANGUARD → PHANTOM
// Weekly Dispatches (reset with week key)
// Changes from v5.6:
//   - REMOVED the helper stub block at the bottom of this file.
//     The stubs (totalDone, allDaily, cyclesDone, gPct, gamePct,
//     allMats, spiralFull, hsrEndgameDone, wwEndgameDone,
//     dispatchesDone, getv) were bare global function declarations
//     that returned 0/false. They only ever worked because
//     index.html loads this file BEFORE app.js, so app.js's real
//     implementations overwrote them. If the script order in
//     index.html were ever changed or a defer/async attribute
//     added, every achievement would silently evaluate false
//     forever — and the try/catch in checkAllAchievements() would
//     hide it. Nothing imports this file standalone, so the stubs
//     served no purpose. Deleted.
//   - Normalized check() calls to match the real app.js signatures:
//     cyclesDone(), hsrEndgameDone(), and wwEndgameDone() take NO
//     arguments (they read getCy() directly). The extra `ws` args
//     were ignored at runtime but were misleading.
//   - No achievement conditions, names, or flavor text changed.
//     PHANTOM names untouched per project rules.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// RUNTIME DEPENDENCY NOTE:
// The check() functions below call helpers defined in app.js at
// global scope: totalDone, allDaily, cyclesDone, gPct, gamePct,
// allMats, spiralFull, hsrEndgameDone, wwEndgameDone,
// dispatchesDone, getv, getCy, and the GAMES array from games.js.
// index.html must keep loading data files BEFORE app.js, and
// checkAllAchievements() only runs after DOM load, so all of these
// resolve by the time any check() is evaluated.
